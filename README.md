# Stock Market Prediction with Deep Learning
This Jupyter notebook provides a framework for predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning models. The project leverages various libraries, including PyTorch, pandas, and yfinance, to build and evaluate a model for stock market data analysis.
## Key Libraries Used
- **PyTorch**: For building and training neural networks.
- **yfinance**: To fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **TQDM**: For progress bars during data processing.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: Interactive plotting.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Setup

To run this notebook, make sure to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy pandas tqdm yfinance seaborn matplotlib plotly scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Project Structure

1. **Data Acquisition**: Stock data is fetched using `yfinance`. In the notebook, the stock symbol (`symbol = "SISE.IS"`) is set to retrieve data for a specific stock (e.g., "SISE.IS" for a Turkish company). Historical data from a starting date is loaded for training the model.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is prepared for machine learning by handling missing values and scaling features as needed.

3. **Model Building**: PyTorch is used to build the neural network model. The model architecture involves using layers such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

4. **Training**: The model is trained on the prepared data, with performance monitored via validation sets.

5. **Evaluation**: The results are evaluated, and performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are displayed. Various plots visualize the model's predictions against the actual data.

## Example Usage

1. **Fetching Stock Data**: You can change the stock symbol in the code (e.g., `symbol = "SISE.IS"`) to fetch data for a different company.
   
2. **Training the Model**: After loading the data, the model is trained using the training dataset, and predictions are made on a test dataset.
   
3. **Visualizing Results**: The modelâ€™s predictions are visualized using plots to compare with the actual stock prices.

## Notes
- This notebook assumes that you have a basic understanding of stock market prediction and deep learning concepts.
- Make sure that your environment has all the dependencies installed.
- The model can be further optimized for better performance by tuning the hyperparameters or trying different architectures.
